    <p>
        Alright, so I'm sitting here, January 9th, 19 years old, having started my period moments ago, freezing cold in my parents' garage room as my cat's clawing at my leg because she wants my mac-n-cheese - and I'm learning to code.
        Technically, while this is my first blog post, today is not *technically* the first day I started learning to code. About a week-ish ago, I started screwing around with ChatGPT (before learning how unreliable it is about code) and tried to start Codecademy (before learning they'd sold out to the capitalists. Whatever. I don't care).
        Today is actually like day 5 of what's called "The Odin Project" - a big, free, online effort by seasoned programmers to give green web developers a realistic growth journey. It seems to really be nailed down, and I'm excited to keep going with it. Granted, I'm going to have to be going at it pretty consistently for like a year to get any actual results, but I have a strong feeling that otherwise I'll be getting *no* results.
        So, here's the big question (which I started writing this intending to answer): *why* am I learning to code?
    </p>

    <p>The Why</p>

    <!--Body-->

    <p>
        There's a few answers to this question. Why do any of us do anything? That's a stupid answer, but a good one. The biggest reason (as of now) is because I like doing things. I like learning, specifically. If me selling my time and soul to go to college for a niche and probably-non-lucrative major doesn't emphasize that, I don't know what will. Most of all, I like *having learned* things, e.g. being able to bust out "I can speak Russian" at dinner parties as a little white girl who's never lived outside of her hometown. That's a big one. Being able to scoot someone's laptop over to fix something with code (that, let's be honest, doesn't require opening the terminal but it looks cool so I'll do it anyway) would be rad as hell, and being able to show other people my creations would be even more so. At some point I'd like to build my own website (hell, my brother already bought the ailsalewis.com domain for $10/month), and maybe even put these blogposts on it. For posterity, I'm currently typing this out unformatted in a brand-new Obsidian vault. But that's getting into the next reason.
        Which is: I'd like to make things. I'd like to be able to push into a new field full of brand-new things to devour like a ravaged kitten chowing down on stolen mac-n-cheese and eventually build some cool crap with it. I'd eventually like to build websites (my own, maybe for some friends as practice, and possibly even as a minor contractor someday). I think it'd be cool to be a full-stack developer because I 1) already have an eye for graphic design 2) don't want to get into the insane stuff just yet while ending up pretty well-versed in something. 
        Third, I want to get into game development. Yes, I know, that's why a bajillion people do it, but web development seems like a good first step into the world of coding instead of diving straight into Unity or something. I have an idea for a game, and I'd like to hold onto it long enough that one day maybe I can use some huge game engine with some real knowledge about how it all works. This was the original reason I picked this up and had enough mojo to find out what I wanted to start with (and convince myself I could do it). 
        Lastly, yes, sigh, it's marketable. My thought is that if i end up really liking it, maybe I can get some crazy job and make a ton of money so I can do crap I like on the side without being miserably poor, and if I don't like it, it'll at least tell hiring managers I'm an irredeemable nerd and can learn complicated things. I'd take anything at this point - the only thing I don't want to do is *not* learn how to code. So I'm going to do it. And I'm going to stick with it. Even if it's a pain in the patookus.

    <p>The How</p>

    <!--Body-->
    <p>
        Obviously, like I mentioned at the beginning, I'm following The Odin Project's curriculum. I've heard it's hard, but it's easier than getting lost in the so-called "Desert of Despair" all by my lonesome. I've joined the Discord (and a second for an indie dev I'm supporting, but maybe that's a blogpost for another time) and am already a little intimidated by everything. People are so smart! And probably insane psychopaths for putting themselves through all this! But I digress. Hopefully it'll kick me into gear and give me some hope that there really *is* a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm hoping to do the "code for an hour a day" thing (though most of it right now is reading about coding), which, of course, we'll see how that goes when classes start again. I have a *lot* of reading this year, so mayyyybe I should go ahead and get started on that. Augustine's *Confessions* is first. Sigh. 
        Back on topic. So far it seems like most of The Odin Project's curriculum comes from curated articles and lessons from other sites that are put into lesson modules with cohesive topics and instructions. I've got a Mac, so that makes some of the setup easier, but so far I've installed VSCode, screwed with the terminal, and have started blogging (journaling)(diarying) in Obsidian. yippee.

    <p>The Rest</p>

    <!--Body-->
    <p>
        I'm running out of adverb questions to title the sections, so I'll just wrap up. I really hope to make this blog (wizard journal)(glittery pink diary) a place where I can work out problems, document solutions, keep track of what I've learned, and follow my progress. Maybe, hopefully, I'll look back at these first few blogposts and think "Wow, I was an ignorant little baby back then" instead of "Wow, I never even got started learning this stuff before I dropped coding". In the meantime, I'm going to do my best to work hard and keep it fun. Even if it's a pain in the patookus.
