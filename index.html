            at least, that's how you may know me on the internet. that's my github username, my discord username, my youtube username, and pretty much all the rest of the usernames. it's a little easier to pronounce than my actual first name, which i have to spell out every time i give someone my email.

            this is my personal blog site. i'm building it from scratch, adding to it piece by piece as i learn more. in case you didn't know, i'm a beginner web developer, and i'm documenting the first steps of my journey here. hopefully this will turn into something complicated and cool and interesting to look at, but right now it's a glorified practice html file that i'm typing out directly in vscode. i'm going to put all my blogposts here and style them, and then i'm going to slowly add functionality so that someday this can be something i can show off. 
        </p>

        <!--Short ending paragraph-->
        <p>
            all that said, follow along with me as i begin the painful and rewarding journey of learning web development on my own.
