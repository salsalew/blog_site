# blog_site
My first personal project.

<p>This'll be the first time I'll be creating a project truly on my own. As of right now I only have HTML and CSS basics down, but as I go I'll be adding to this site as practice. I also wanted a place to put my personal blog posts for the future instead of keeping them only in Obsidian.<p>
