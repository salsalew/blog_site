This is the checklist for whenever I add a new blog post:


    1. Fill in template with content, making sure to delete the comments after you follow their directions

    2. Link the previous blog page at the bottom (double-check it works)

    3. Link the current blogpage in the "home" link at the bottom of the previous page and change the text to "next"

    4. Add entry to directory

    5. Update "latest blog" on the homepage


    You should be done then and only then. I'll add any extra issues if there should be any during testing.
